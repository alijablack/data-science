# data-science
Welcome to the Data Science repository. I have included Data Science projects from my studies in the field focused on key modeling methods such as:
- Hierarchical Clustering
- XG Boost
- Linear Regression
- Multivariate Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Natural Language Processing
- Convolutional Neural Networks

My journey into the field was inspired by how to apply data science for social good. My first attempt involved a team research project using *Hierarchical Clustering* for Early Childhood Education Equity in New Mexico presented to the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department and statewide early education policy thinktanks and nonprofit advocacy organizations.
